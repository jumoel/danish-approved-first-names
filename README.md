Download of approved danish first names
=======================================

Downloads approved first names from www.familiestyrelsen.dk.

Can download boys', girls' and unisex names based on parameters to the scripts.

*Usage*:

    phantomjs navne.js <nametype> <outfile>

Nametype can be one of `drengenavne` (boys' names), `pigenavne` (girls' names), `unisexnavne` (unisex names).

Please note that this scraper is useless. The site has direct CSV download. I'm just blind :-)
